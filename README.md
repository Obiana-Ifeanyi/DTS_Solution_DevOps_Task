# DTS Solution DevOps Task

Welcome to the repository for the DTS Solution DevOps Task. This repository contains instructions and configurations for setting up a Kubernetes cluster, defining pod specifications, configuring RBAC roles, deploying pods, scaling worker nodes, and testing and troubleshooting the application.

## Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster:

1. Choose a Kubernetes service provider or set up your own Kubernetes cluster using tools like Minikube, kops, or kubeadm.
2. Ensure that `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command-line tool, is installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.

## Define Pod Specifications:

1. Create YAML files for each of the required pods (nginx, MongoDB).
2. For the nginx pods, define a Deployment resource to ensure high availability and easy scaling.
3. For the MongoDB pod, use a StatefulSet to manage the database's persistent data.
4. Define resource requests and limits to ensure proper resource allocation.
5. Utilize Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing configurations and sensitive information like database credentials.

## Define RBAC roles and role bindings to grant access to the MongoDB database:

1. Create a ServiceAccount for users or applications that need access to the MongoDB database.
2. Define a Role that specifies the permissions users will have (e.g., read, write) on the MongoDB resources.
3. Bind the Role to the ServiceAccount using a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding.

## Configuring Pod Networking:

1. Ensure proper networking configurations to allow communication between pods and external access to services like nginx.
2. Use Kubernetes Services to provide stable endpoints for accessing the nginx instances.
3. For MongoDB, consider using a Service of type ClusterIP for internal access within the cluster.

## Deploying the Pods:

1. Use `kubectl apply` or `kubectl create` to deploy the defined pod specifications to the Kubernetes cluster.
2. Monitor the deployment process using `kubectl` commands like `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl describe pods`, etc.
3. Verify that the pods are running correctly and that the desired number of replicas for nginx and MongoDB are available.

## Scaling the Worker Nodes:

1. Set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for the nginx Deployment to automatically scale based on CPU or custom metrics.
2. Use `kubectl autoscale` command to configure HPA for the nginx Deployment.
3. Monitor the cluster's resource usage and scaling behavior to ensure optimal performance.

## Testing and Troubleshooting:

1. Test the application's functionality to ensure that nginx instances are serving content correctly.
2. Troubleshoot any issues by examining pod logs, cluster events, and using standard debugging techniques.
3. Iterate on configurations and deployments as needed to address any issues encountered during testing.

Feel free to reach out for any questions or assistance with the setup and deployment process. Happy coding!
